    <h2>Come for the love,<br>stay for the cake!</h2>
    
    <p class="story-paragraph">
        It all began within the four walls of our high school classroom. Back then, we were just two teenagers in uniforms, worried about exams and homework, completely unaware that we were sitting next to our future. What started with shy glances and borrowing notes slowly turned into the realization that school was just a lot more fun when we were together.

    <p class="story-paragraph">
        As we traded our backpacks for briefcases and moved from teenage drama to 'adulting,' we navigated every phase of life side-by-side. We grew up, changed, and evolved, but somehow, we never grew apart. Through graduations, new jobs, and all the chaotic moments in between, we became each other's constant and safest place to land.
    </p>

    <p class="story-paragraph">
        Now, after all these years, we are ready to start the biggest chapter yet. The person who used to be just a classmate has become a soulmate and a life partner. We are so excited to make it official and continue this journey, no longer just as high school sweethearts, but as husband and wife.
